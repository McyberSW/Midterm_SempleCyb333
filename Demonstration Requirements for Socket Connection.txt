Side: Set up the server socket by creating a TCP socket using the
﻿socket module. Use
﻿AF

INET for the address family and
﻿SOCK

: Handle Multiple Clients and Messages
﻿Server
-
Side: Extend the server to handle multiple clients. Use the
﻿cept
(
)
 ﻿method in a loop to
﻿accept incoming client connections. Each time a client connects, start a new thread using the
﻿ac
﻿thread
﻿ing module to handle that client

﻿Client
-
Side: Once connected, the client should continuously prompt the user for input

.
,
 ﻿the
﻿message to be sent
)
.
 ﻿Send the inputted message to the server using the
﻿send
(
)
 ﻿method. Simultane
ously, listen for incoming broadcast messages from the server using the
﻿the
﻿thread
﻿recv
(
)
 ﻿method. You can use
﻿ing module to handle message sending and receiving in parallel. inject flaws
﻿Input Parameters: The input parameters remain the same as in Task 
1
.
 ﻿The server.py script should
﻿continue to take the port number as the input parameter. The client.py script should continue to
﻿take two input parameters: the server
’
s IP address and the port number. inject flaws
﻿Testing: Run the server and connect multiple clients by running the client script in multiple
﻿terminal windows. Ensure that the server accepts connections and creates a new thread for each
﻿client. Print confirmation messages to the console to verify that new clients are being handled
﻿correctly. Test by typing a message in one client and verifying that it is sent to the server and
﻿broadcast to other connected clients. Ensure the message is received correctly by all clients. Run at

: Implement Message Broadcasting
﻿Server
-
Side: Implement message broadcasting in the server. When a client sends a message to the
﻿server, the server should broadcast this message to all other connected clients. inject flaws
﻿Input Parameters: The input parameters remain the same as in Task

﻿Testing: After implementing broadcasting, test by sending a message from one client and verifying
﻿that all other connected clients receive the message. Confirm that the server does not send the
﻿message back to the client that sent it

: Handle Disconnections and Graceful Exits

﻿during communication, the server should remove the client from the list of active connections and
﻿close the client

Side: Implement a command

.
 ﻿Ensure that the server correctly removes the disconnected client from its list without
﻿crashing and that remaining clients continue to function normally. Also, test graceful disconnection
